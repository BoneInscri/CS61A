**Exercise 3.1.** 

An *accumulator* is a procedure that is **called repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum.** 

Each time it is called, it returns the currently accumulated sum. 

Write a procedure `make-accumulator` that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. 

The input to `make-accumulator` **should specify the initial value of the sum**; for example

```lisp
(define A (make-accumulator 5))
(A 10)
; 15
(A 10)
; 25
```

（1）实现 make-accumulator 

（2）每次调用就是进行累加
