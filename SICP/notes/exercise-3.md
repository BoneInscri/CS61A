#### **Exercise 3.1.** 

An *accumulator* is a procedure that is **called repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum.** 

Each time it is called, it returns the currently accumulated sum. 

Write a procedure `make-accumulator` that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. 

The input to `make-accumulator` **should specify the initial value of the sum**; for example

```lisp
(define A (make-accumulator 5))
(A 10)
; 15
(A 10)
; 25
```

（1）实现 make-accumulator 

（2）每次调用就是进行累加



#### **Exercise 3.2.** 

In software-testing applications, it is useful to be able to **count the number of times a given procedure is called during the course of a computation.** 

Write a procedure `make-monitored` that takes as input a procedure, `f`, that itself takes one input. 

The result returned by `make-monitored` is a third procedure, **say `mf`, that keeps track of the number of times it has been called by maintaining an internal counter.** 

If the input to `mf` is the special symbol `how-many-calls?`, **then `mf` returns the value of the counter.** 

If the input is the special symbol `reset-count`, **then `mf` resets the counter to zero.** 

For **any other input, `mf` returns the result of calling `f` on that input and increments the counter.** 

For instance, we could make a monitored version of the `sqrt` procedure:

```lisp
(define s (make-monitored sqrt))

(s 100)
; 10

(s 'how-many-calls?)
; 1
```

（1）统计一个过程被调用了多少次。

（2）实现 make-monitored。

（3）how-many-calls？返回counter。

（4）reset-count，重设counter为0。

（5）其他的值，就直接将参数作为被监控程序
